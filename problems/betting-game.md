# A betting game

You are involved in a betting game whose rules are as follows:

- If you win a round, the bet amount will be added to your sum and next bet amount will be $1;
- If you lose a round, the bet amount will be reduced from your total sum and next bet will be twice the previous.
- The game ends when all the rounds are complete or you dont have sufficient sum.

Initially, you are given with a string of the form “WLWWL” where W indicates a win and L indicates a 
loss and initial sum. Initial bet amount will be $1.

You need to find the amount at the end of the game. Function prototypes and main was given for both questions
